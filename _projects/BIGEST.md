## Software development

### CEToolbox

<p>
The <a href="https://cetoolbox.github.io/" target="_blank">CEToolbox</a>
application is a calculator for capillary electrophoresis for Android devices.
It aims to provide several information on the separation of compounds like the
hydrodynamic injection, the volume of the capillary, the injection plug length
or the quantity of injected analyte. The application works with any type of CE
system. The description of the software has been published in a
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ELPS.202100036" target="_blank">scientific article</a>.
This software is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

### Mychem

<p>
<a href="https://mychem.github.io/" target="_blank">Mychem</a> is a
chemoinformatics extension for MySQL and MariaDB released under the
GNU GPL license. It provides a set of functions that permits to handle
chemical data within the database. These functions permit to search,
analyze and convert chemical data. It is based on <a href="http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Open Babel</a>.
