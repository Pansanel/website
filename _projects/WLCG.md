## Overview

<p>
The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) project is a global collaboration of
around 170 computing centres in more than 40 countries, linking up national
and international grid infrastructures.
</p>

<p>
The mission of the WLCG project is to provide global computing resources to
store, distribute and analyse the ~50-70 Petabytes of data expected every
year of operations from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN on the
Franco-Swiss border. The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid is partnered with <a href="https://www.egi.eu/" target="_blank">EGI</a>,
<a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/" target="_blank">OSG</a> and <a href="https://neic.no/" target="_blank">ENeIC</a>.

## My activities

<p>
Through my activities at the  <a href="https://grand-est.fr" target="_blank">SCIGNE platform</a>,
I am involved in the <a href="https://home.cern/fr/science/cms" target="_blank">CMS</a>
and <a href="https://home.cern/fr/science/alice" target="_blank">ALICE</a>
experiences (two of the largest experiments in the world devoted to research
in the physics of matter at an infinitely small scale). I provide support to
local users, as well as the development of computing infrastructures and
services to meet the requirements of these experiences.
