## Overview

<p>
The ambition of the European Open Science Cloud, known as EOSC, is to
develop a 'Web of FAIR Data and Services’ for science in Europe. EOSC
will be a multi-disciplinary environment where researchers can publish,
find and re-use data, tools and services, enabling them to better
conduct their work.
</p>

<p>
EOSC builds on existing infrastructure and services supported by the
European Commission, Member States and research communities. It brings
these together in a federated ‘system of systems’ approach, adding value
by aggregating content and enabling services to be used together.
</p>

<p>
This environment will operate under well-defined conditions to ensure
trust and safeguard the public interest. Expectations of service
providers and users will be made explicit to ensure appropriate
behaviour.
</p>

<p>
EOSC is supported by the European Commission as part of the Horizon
2020 call for projects. I take part in several of them.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>FAIR IMPACT (2022-2024)</li>
  <li>FAIR EASE (2022-2024)</li>
  <li>EGI ACE (2021-2023)</li>
  <li>EOSC-Pillar (2019-2022)</li>
</ul>
