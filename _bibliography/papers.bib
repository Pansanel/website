	abstract = {The possible role played by individual attributes, sociodemographic characteristics and/or ecological pressures in the interaction between animals and the development of social relationships between them is of great interest in animal ecology and evolutionary biology. Social Network Analysis is an ideal tool to study these types of questions. The Animal Network Toolkit Software (ANTs) R package was specifically developed to provide all the different social network analysis techniques currently used in the study of animal social networks. This global package enables users to (1) compute global, polyadic and nodal network measures; (2) perform data randomisation: data stream and network (node and link) permutations; (3) perform statistical permutation tests for static or temporal network analyses, and (4) visualise networks. ANTs allows researchers to perform multilevel network analyses ranging from individual network measures to interaction patterns and the analysis of the overall network structure, and carry out static or temporal network analyses without switching between different R packages, thus making a substantial contribution to advances in the study of animal behaviour. ANTs outperforms existing R packages for the computation speed of network measures and permutations.},

	abstract = {In myriad biological systems, multiple lines of evidence indicate that modularity, wherein parts of a network are organized into modules such as subgroups in animal networks, may affect social transmission processes. In animal societies, there is increased interest in understanding variation in the effects of modularity on transmission as it may provide important insight into a given network’s performance, in addition to the evolutionary consequences the structure of the network may have for individual fitness. Yet, to our knowledge, the degree to which network efficiency is modularity dependent has not yet been investigated in great detail in behavioral and evolutionary ecology. Here, we investigated to what degree network efficiency, as a proxy for social transmission, is modularity dependent. We created 2798 networks varying in group size and density, and tested whether network structure (density, Newman’s modularity, eigenvector centralization) and group size shape network efficiency. We also used published data from 41 primate social networks to test whether the predictions generated in our simulations were supported by empirical observations. Our results show a non-linear relationship between modularity and global efficiency, with the latter peaking at intermediate values of modularity in both theoretical and empirical networks. This phenomenon may have relevance for observed variation in social structure and its link with network performance. Our results may thus provide a basis from which to discuss the evolution of complex systems such as animal societies.},

The calculated TDCSs using both the CW and DW models are in better agreement with experimental data than those obtained using the molecular three-body distorted wave model.

Animal group structures change over time and interactions among individuals occur in particular orders that may be repeated following specific patterns, change in their nature, or disappear completely. Here we used a stochastic actor-oriented model built using the RSiena package in R to estimate individual behaviors and their changes through time, by analyzing the dynamic of the interaction network of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster during social learning experiments. In particular, we re-analyzed an experimental dataset where uninformed flies, left free to interact with informed ones, acquired and later used information about oviposition site choice obtained by social interactions. We estimated the degree to which the uninformed flies had successfully acquired the information carried by informed individuals using the proportion of eggs laid by uninformed flies on the medium their conspecifics had been trained to favor. Regardless of the degree of information acquisition measured in uninformed individuals, they always received and started interactions more frequently than informed ones did. However, information was efficiently transmitted (i.e. uninformed flies predominantly laid eggs on the same medium informed ones had learn to prefer) only when the difference in contacts sent between the two fly types was small. Interestingly, we found that the degree of reciprocation, the tendency of individuals to form mutual connections between each other, strongly affected oviposition site choice in uninformed flies. This work highlights the great potential of RSiena and its utility in the studies of interaction networks among non-human animals.},

	abstract = {The Higgs boson was postulated nearly five decades ago within the framework of the standard model of particle physics and has been the subject of numerous searches at accelerators around the world. Its discovery would verify the existence of a complex scalar field thought to give mass to three of the carriers of the electroweak force—the W+, W–, and Z0 bosons—as well as to the fundamental quarks and leptons. The CMS Collaboration has observed, with a statistical significance of five standard deviations, a new particle produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The evidence is strongest in the diphoton and four-lepton (electrons and/or muons) final states, which provide the best mass resolution in the CMS detector. The probability of the observed signal being due to a random fluctuation of the background is about 1 in 3 × 106. The new particle is a boson with spin not equal to 1 and has a mass of about 125 giga–electron volts. Although its measured properties are, within the uncertainties of the present data, consistent with those expected of the Higgs boson, more data are needed to elucidate the precise nature of the new particle.
The CMS detector team describes their experiment and observation of decay products from a standard model Higgs boson, allowing its mass to be determined.

Whereas for both tectons 1 and 2 the network is generated through the interconnection of the organic moieties by copper dimers of the paddle-wheel type, in the case of 3, the 2-D network is formed by another type of connector, a binuclear copper complex for which the two metal centres adopt an octahedral coordination geometry.},
