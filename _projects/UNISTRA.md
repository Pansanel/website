## Overview

<p>
The <a href="https://www.unistra.fr" target="_blank">University of Strasbourg</a>
is a leading European university in terms of research, teaching and knowledge
transfer. In 2019, the university launched an ambitious project to
develop Open Science through <a href="https://scienceouverte.unistra.fr/en" target="_blank">several initiatives</a>.
It is based on height pillars covering the themes defined in the 
<a href="https://www.leru.org/files/LERU-AP24-Open-Science-full-paper.pdf" target="_blank">LERU roadmap</a>.
I am in charge of the second pillar, dedicated to FAIR data (which includes also software).
