## Overview

<p>
The IPHC, a joint research unit under the joint supervision of the
CNRS and the University of Strasbourg (UMR7178), is a successful
example of multidisciplinarity where research teams from different
scientific cultures (ecology, physiology and ethology, chemistry
and subatomic physics) are developing very high-level multidisciplinary
programs based on scientific instrumentation. It is located on the
Cronenbourg campus in Strasbourg and currently employs 400 people in 22
teams.

<p>
As chief technical officer at IPHC, I am implementing technology
strategies, and ensure that the technological resources are aligned
with the research group needs.
