## Overview

<p>
SCIGNE is a platform dedicated to the processing and management of massive
scientific data. Hosted at <a href="http://www.iphc.cnrs.fr" target="_blank">IPHC</a>,
it is open to regional, national and international scientific actors. It has
a calculation and storage infrastructure for data recognised at European level
and interconnected with the infrastructures of several partners (
<a href="http://www.france-grilles.fr" target="_blank">France Grilles</a>,
<a href="https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/" target="_blank">IFB</a>,
<a href="https://www.egi.eu" target="_blank">EGI</a> and <a href="https://wlcg.web.cern.ch/" target="_blank">WLCG</a>).
Its team of engineers with technical expertise offers a large range of
complementary scientific services (scientific software development, IA training,
user training, implementation of data management plan, ...) allowing to
respond to the challenges of Big Data and the implementation of Open Science.

## Software development

Despite my responsibilities within the SCIGNE platform, as well as in other projects, I still have some time left to contribute to free software development.

### Quattor

<p>
<a href="https://www.quattor.org" target="_blank">Quattor</a> is a system
administration toolkit providing a powerful, portable, and modular set of
tools for the automated installation, configuration, and management of
clusters, farms, grids and clouds. I am contributing mainly to grid- and
cloud-related components. Software development related to Quattor are
available on <a href="https://github.com/Quattor" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
</p>

### Cloudkeeper-os

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/Pansanel/cloudkeeper-os/" target="_blank">Cloudkeeper-OS</a>
is the OpenStack backend for  <a href="https://github.com/the-cloudkeeper-project/cloudkeeper" target="_blank">Cloudkeeper</a>,
a software for keeping OpenStack image list up to date with the
<a href="https://appdb.egi.eu" target="_blank">EGI central repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
I have also started the  <a href="https://github.com/Pansanel/imagekeeper" target="_blank">ImageKeeper</a>
project, whose objective is to provide an independent tool for synchronising
images on different Clouds.
</p>

### OpenStack security

<p>
I am maintaining currently two  <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack</a>
security-related software:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/FranceGrilles/openstack-triggers" target="_blank">OpenStack Triggers</a>:
    A set of SQL scripts that permit to log additionnal information in the
    OpenStack database.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Pansanel/openstack-user-tools" target="_blank">OpenStack User Tool</a>:
    A set of Python tools for helping day-to-day OpenStack operations.
  </li>
</ul>
